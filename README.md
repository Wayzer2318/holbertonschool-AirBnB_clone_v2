## Description

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

A command interpreter to manage our Airbnb clone objects:

 * Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
 * Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
 * Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
 * Update attributes of an object
 * Destroy an object

 * All your files must be executable
 * The length of your files will be tested using wc
 * All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
 * All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
 * All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

## Requirements for Python unit tests

 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

for models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
 * All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
