# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
---

## Description

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

A command interpreter to manage our Airbnb clone objects:

 * Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
 * Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
 * Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
 * Update attributes of an object
 * Destroy an object


### List of allowed functions and system calls


## Requirements for Python Scripts

 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
 * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 * Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7 or more)
 * All your files must be executable
 * The length of your files will be tested using wc
 * All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
 * All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
 * All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

## Requirements for Python unit tests

 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * All your test files should be inside a folder tests
 * You have to use the unittest module
 * All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
 * All your test files and folders should start by test_
 * Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project:
for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
for models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
 * All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
 * You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
 * All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
 * All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
 * All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
