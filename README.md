# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
---

## Description

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

A command interpreter to manage our Airbnb clone objects:

 * Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
 * Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
 * Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
 * Update attributes of an object
 * Destroy an object
